		<h1>Sensor View Help</h1>
		<p>When the view is started a <b>Service Discovery</b> is initiated. On <b>Service Discovery</b> completion (may take a few seconds),
		sensor images appear and data is displayed next to them. The <b>Preferences</b> tab in the options menu can be used to select <i>which</i> sensors
		to show. Note that a maximum of four sensors may be activated per connection instance due to a limitation in Android's Bluetooth low energy stack on the number of 
		notifications.</p>
		<p>Note that the magnetometer and height measurement of the barometer are calibrated by tapping on the respective entry in the sensor list. The measured height shown
		is calculated based on the difference in air pressure between the current measurement and the pressure at the moment of calibration. Both measurements are calibrated
		on connection (but may be re-calibrated any time).</p>
		<p>The SensorTag firmware can be upgraded OTA (Over The Air) via <b>Firmware Update</b> in the Options Menu. The application will contain images for the latest firmware, 
		but it is also possible to download custom images from Android's 'Download' directory. There are 
		two FW images for each FW revision. These are labeled <q>A</q> and <q>B</q> and differ only by the destination address in the 
		SensorTag flash. Alternative images must always be used; if the current image in flash is of type <q>A</q> the new one must of type 
		<q>B</q> and vice versa.
