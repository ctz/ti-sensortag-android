	  <h1>Scan View Help</h1>
		<p>Provided that the <b>Bluetooth Adapter</b> is available and turned on and Bluetooth low energy supported on the device 
		(the application will request to turn the adapter on if detected off at start-up), the <b>BLE SensorTag App</b> 
	  will start device discovery (scanning) automatically. Scanning will stop when any of the following conditions is met:</p>
	  <ul>
	  <li><b>Stop</b> button tapped</b>
	  <li>A <b>device</b> in the list tapped</li>
	  <li><b>Ten seconds</b> elapsed since scanning started</li>
	  </ul>
		<p>Scanning can be restarted any time by tapping the <b>Scan</b> button. During scanning Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values are continuously updated. Note that
		some devices do not provide continuous scan results (Nexus 4, Nexus 7 2013), on these devices the RSSI value will appear only once. 
		When a device in the list is selected by the user, the application will attempt to connect to it. If the connection succeeds, 
		the <u>Device View</u> will be launched, and this is where data from the enabled sensors are displayed. If connection times out an error message
		is displayed. This will happen when the SensorTag doesn't advertise, so always make sure it is advertising by pushing the side button on the SensorTag
		(this button toggles advertising).</p>
		<p>The options menu gives direct access to the SensorTag web page, and to TI's e2e forum. The Bluetooth settings dialog can also
		be accessed from here. There is also a brief About dialog with information about the SensorTag, the Android device name and the Android build.
